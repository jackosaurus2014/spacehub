PRIORITY: MEDIUM-HIGH
Rationale: ESG is increasingly important to investors and regulators. The FCC's
2024 5-year deorbiting rule and ESA's Zero Debris Charter signal growing
regulatory momentum. However, comprehensive data collection is challenging --
many metrics require manual research or corporate self-reporting. Start with
debris mitigation scoring (most data available) and expand.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STANDALONE VS INTEGRATED:
Standalone module, with connections to:
- Lunar Gateway (existing) - this module extends and deepens it
- Space Mining (existing) - lunar ISRU is a subset of space mining
- Mission Control (existing) - Artemis mission tracking
- Business Opportunities (existing) - lunar contract opportunities

Note: Consider whether this should EXTEND the existing Lunar Gateway module
rather than being fully standalone. The existing module could be expanded to
become "Cislunar Economy & Lunar Gateway."

PRIORITY: MEDIUM-HIGH
Rationale: The cislunar economy is real and growing rapidly. Multiple commercial
lunar missions have landed or are manifested. However, data is scattered and
mostly comes from press releases and government sources rather than structured
APIs. This module would aggregate nicely but requires significant manual
curation. Could be phased -- start by extending the existing Lunar Gateway
module.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MODULE 5: SPACE DEFENSE & NATIONAL SECURITY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION:

PRIORITY: MEDIUM
Rationale: High value for a specific audience (defense industry), but
politically sensitive. Must be carefully scoped to OSINT only. Competitors like
SpaceNews cover this well. The real value-add is aggregation of contract data
from SAM.gov with strategic analysis. Consider starting with just the
procurement/contracts aspect, which is less sensitive and more actionable.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Business Opportunities (existing) - match opportunities to vehicles

PRIORITY: HIGH
Rationale: This is a "table stakes" feature for any serious space intelligence
platform. Every space professional needs this data, and while some of it exists
in scattered sources, no single platform offers a comprehensive, up-to-date,
interactive comparison. Relatively straightforward to build since most data is
publicly available and changes infrequently. High SEO value as well.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- BryceTech state of the space industry reports
- Local government economic development publications

STANDALONE VS INTEGRATED:
Standalone module.
Integration points:
- Ground Station Map (existing) - often co-located
- Launch Windows (existing) - site determines launch azimuth
- Launch Vehicle Comparison (proposed) - vehicle-site compatibility
- Mission Control (existing) - launch site for upcoming missions

PRIORITY: MEDIUM
Rationale: Useful reference tool with broad appeal. The data is relatively
static (spaceports don't change frequently) which makes maintenance easy.
The interactive map feature would be visually compelling. However, it's more
of a reference tool than an intelligence tool -- it tells you what exists
rather than providing actionable insights. Could be a quick win due to
simplicity. Consider combining with Ground Station Map for a
"Space Infrastructure Map" super-module.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MODULE 10: SPACE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK

PRIORITY: MEDIUM-HIGH
Rationale: Space stations are a high-interest topic with broad appeal.
The ISS transition to commercial stations is a major story. Real-time ISS
tracking is a proven crowd-pleaser. The data is mostly available from public
sources. This module would be visually compelling and serve as a good
engagement driver.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MODULE 13: REGULATORY FILING TRACKER
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION:
A real-time tracker for regulatory filings related to the space industry,

PRIORITY: HIGH
Rationale: This is genuine intelligence that professionals will pay for.
Tracking FCC satellite filings provides early signals of competitive moves
(e.g., when a company files for a new constellation, it signals market entry
months before any announcement). FAA license data shows launch activity
trends. The data sources have APIs or structured databases making this
technically feasible. This module would be highly differentiated from
competitors.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================================
IV. INDUSTRY DATA GAP ANALYSIS
================================================================================

What Space Industry Professionals Currently Lack:
--------------------------------------------------

1. INTEGRATED REGULATORY INTELLIGENCE
   Professionals currently must manually check FCC IBFS, FAA licenses, ITU
   BRIFIC, and Federal Register separately. There is no single platform that
   aggregates all space-related regulatory filings and provides alerts.
   >> ADDRESSED BY: Regulatory Filing Tracker module

2. REAL-TIME MARKET INTELLIGENCE
   SIA, Space Foundation, and Euroconsult publish annual reports. There is
   no continuously-updated view of the space economy. Investors and executives
   rely on stale data for fast-moving decisions.
   >> ADDRESSED BY: Space Economy Dashboard module

3. LAUNCH VEHICLE TRADE STUDY TOOLS
   Mission planners currently build their own spreadsheets comparing launch
   vehicles. No public tool offers a comprehensive, maintained, interactive
   comparison.
   >> ADDRESSED BY: Launch Vehicle Comparison Tool module

4. LEGAL & POLICY TRACKING
   Space lawyers must subscribe to multiple newsletters and manually track
   legislation across dozens of countries. No aggregated legal intelligence
   platform exists for space law.
   >> ADDRESSED BY: Space Law & Treaty Monitor module

5. ESG / SUSTAINABILITY METRICS
   As ESG requirements grow, there are no standardized sustainability
   ratings for space companies or missions. The Space Sustainability Rating
   (SSR) from WEF/EPFL is nascent and covers only individual missions, not
   companies holistically.
   >> ADDRESSED BY: Space Sustainability & ESG module

6. PATENT LANDSCAPE VISIBILITY
   Space technology patent analysis requires expensive tools (Clarivate) or
   manual searching. No space-specific patent intelligence tool exists.
   >> ADDRESSED BY: Patent & IP Tracker module

7. COMMERCIAL STATION COMPARISON
   With 4+ commercial stations in development, there is no tool to compare
   their capabilities, timelines, and pricing for potential customers.
   >> ADDRESSED BY: Space Station Tracker module

8. CISLUNAR ECONOMY OVERVIEW
   The cislunar economy data is scattered across NASA program pages, company
   press releases, and conference presentations. No consolidated view exists.
