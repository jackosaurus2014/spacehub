COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS
-------------------------------

A. SpaceWatch.Global
   What they do well:
   - Deep editorial content with geopolitical analysis
   - Global correspondents (particularly strong in Asia/China coverage)
   - Free newsletter with high engagement
   - Partner with major conferences (DGI 2026, etc.)
   - Regular "Insights" series with proprietary analysis

   What we can learn:
   - Their China space coverage is a differentiated moat -- we should add dedicated
     country/regional space program tracking
   - Their editorial voice attracts a loyal following; we need original editorial
   - They cover the full geopolitical dimension; our defense module scratches the surface

B. BryceTech (now Analysys Mason subsidiary for NSR)
   What they do well:
   - "Start-Up Space" annual report is the definitive VC funding reference
   - Deep quantitative market models with forecasting
   - Government contract support and consulting relationships
   - Comprehensive data sets on launch, satellite, and investment
   - Credibility from 20+ years of analytical work

   What we can learn:
   - Their reports cost $3,000-$10,000+ each; this is the pricing gap we exploit
   - They do NOT have a real-time SaaS platform; their delivery is PDFs and consulting
   - We should replicate their key data products in interactive, always-updated format
   - Their "Start-Up Space" dataset = our Startup Tracker module could be a killer feature

C. Quilty Space
   What they do well:
   - Daily news flash emails curated for subscribers
   - Company deep-dive reports
   - M&A and investment tracker
   - Public company earnings analysis
   - Complete landscape mapping of space companies + constellations
   - Financial-analyst-grade research (founder is ex-Wall Street)

   What we can learn:
   - Their platform is subscription-based with premium tiers likely $5,000-15,000+/yr
   - We need better financial analytics -- earnings calendars, financial model templates
   - Company deep-dives with competitive intelligence is a killer feature we lack
   - Their M&A tracker is something we should build into Market Intelligence

D. NSR (Northern Sky Research, now Analysys Mason)
   What they do well:
   - Multi-year forecasting models for satellite markets
   - 150+ years of combined analyst experience
   - Quantitative market sizing that becomes industry reference
   - Consulting relationships with governments worldwide

   What we can learn:
   - NSR's forecasting capability is their moat; we need predictive analytics
   - They segment markets (GEO vs LEO, HTS, IoT, etc.) at granular level
   - Their pricing ($thousands per report) validates our affordable-access positioning

E. Seradata (SpaceTrak)
   What they do well:
   - SpaceTrak3: the most comprehensive satellite/launch database in the industry
   - Queryable database with custom reports, saved queries, dashboards
   - Updated every working day
   - Used by insurers, manufacturers, agencies worldwide
   - Insurance claim data and failure analysis
   - 25+ years of historical data

   What we can learn:
   - Their database model (queryable + exportable) is gold standard for operational users
   - Our Satellite Tracker is consumer-facing; we need professional-grade data depth
   - Insurance data integration is a major differentiator we should pursue
   - Failure/anomaly database would complement our Space Insurance module

REVENUE MODEL ANALYSIS
-----------------------

Current Pricing Structure:
  Free:       $0         (news, mission control, basic tools)
  Pro:        $9.99/mo   ($99/yr)  -- unlimited access, exports, alerts
  Enterprise: $29.99/mo  ($250/yr) -- AI tools, compliance, API, teams

Problem: Current pricing is far too low for B2B professional tools.
The space industry spends $3,000-$15,000+ per seat on competitive products.
At $99/yr, we need 5,050 paying users for $500K -- unrealistic in a niche market.
At $250/yr enterprise, we need 2,000 paying users.
