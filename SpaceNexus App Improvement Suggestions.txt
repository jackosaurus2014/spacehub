================================================================================
1. CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)
================================================================================

1.1 CREDENTIAL SECURITY
-----------------------
ISSUE: .env file contains exposed credentials
- DATABASE_URL with PostgreSQL credentials
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (functional API key)
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET set to weak placeholder value

ACTION REQUIRED:
[ ] Rotate all exposed API keys immediately
    NOTE: Operational task - must be done manually in Railway dashboard
[ ] Move all secrets to Railway environment variables
    NOTE: Operational task - must be done manually in Railway dashboard
[ ] Generate a strong NEXTAUTH_SECRET (32+ character random string)
    NOTE: Operational task - must be done manually in Railway dashboard
[x] Add .env to .gitignore (if not already)
    DONE: .env is in .gitignore (line 28)
[x] Never commit .env files to version control
    DONE: .gitignore configured

1.2 AUTHENTICATION HARDENING
----------------------------
ISSUE: Error messages reveal user existence (enumeration attack risk)
File: src/lib/auth.ts

[x] FIXED: Now uses "Invalid credentials" for both missing user and wrong
    password (src/lib/auth.ts lines 24, 33). No user enumeration possible.

Additional Auth Improvements Needed:
[x] Add rate limiting on login attempts (prevent brute force)
    DONE: Middleware rate limiter in src/middleware.ts (10 req/hour for
    register, per-endpoint sliding window)
[x] Implement password reset functionality
    DONE: Full flow with PasswordResetToken model, /api/auth/forgot-password,
    /api/auth/reset-password, forgot-password and reset-password pages,
    email template via Resend, rate limited to 5 req/hour.
[x] Add email verification on signup
    DONE: User model has emailVerified + verificationToken fields.
    Registration sends verification email via Resend. /api/auth/verify-email
    endpoint and /verify-email page handle token validation.
[ ] Consider adding OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
[ ] Add two-factor authentication option

1.3 INPUT VALIDATION
--------------------
ISSUE: Insufficient input validation across API endpoints

Recommendations:
[x] Install Zod for schema validation
    DONE: zod@^4.3.6 installed. 15+ schemas in src/lib/validations.ts
[x] Add validation middleware for all API routes
    DONE: validateBody() helper in src/lib/validations.ts used across routes
[x] Implement max limits on pagination (prevent huge data requests)
    DONE: constrainPagination() in src/lib/errors.ts (max 100 default)
[x] Sanitize HTML content from RSS feeds (XSS prevention)
    DONE: Installed sanitize-html. Replaced regex stripping in news-fetcher.ts
    and blogs-fetcher.ts. Added escapeHtml() for email template interpolation.
[x] Add CSRF protection for form submissions
    DONE: Origin/Referer header check in src/middleware.ts for mutations

================================================================================
2. CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

2.1 INCONSISTENT PRISMA USAGE
-----------------------------
[x] FIXED: All API routes now use singleton import from @/lib/db.
    Verified across contact, companies, events, search routes.

2.2 ADD TESTING FRAMEWORK
-------------------------
[x] Install Jest + React Testing Library
    DONE: jest@^29.7.0, jest.config.ts, jest.setup.ts configured
[x] Add unit tests for utility functions (types/index.ts formatters)
    DONE: src/lib/__tests__/validations.test.ts, errors.test.ts
[x] Add integration tests for critical API routes
    DONE: contact-validation.test.ts (10 tests), news-categorizer.test.ts
    (13 tests). 80 total tests across 4 suites, all passing.
[ ] Add E2E tests with Playwright for user flows
[x] Set up CI/CD pipeline with test requirements
    DONE: .github/workflows/ci.yml runs lint, tests, and build on push/PR
    to dev and master branches.

2.3 STANDARDIZE ERROR HANDLING
------------------------------
[x] Create error utility functions
    DONE: Comprehensive src/lib/errors.ts with validationError(),
    forbiddenError(), notFoundError(), rateLimitedError(), internalError(), etc.
[x] Use consistent HTTP status codes
    DONE: Error helpers return proper status codes
[ ] Add error tracking service (Sentry)

2.4 CONTACT FORM PERSISTENCE
----------------------------
[x] FIXED: Contact submissions now persist to database via Prisma
    contactSubmission model (src/app/api/contact/route.ts lines 33-42)

================================================================================
3. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS
================================================================================

3.1 ADD CACHING LAYER
---------------------
Current: No application-level caching

Recommendations:
[ ] Add Redis/Upstash for frequently accessed data
[ ] Implement caching for:
    - Company listings (5-minute cache)
    - News articles (1-minute cache)
    - Space events (5-minute cache)
    - Stock quotes (real-time but debounced)
[ ] Add cache invalidation on data updates

3.2 DATABASE QUERY OPTIMIZATION
-------------------------------
Issues found:
- JSON parsing done in application for every result
- Some queries lack field selection
- Pagination without max limits

Fixes:
[x] Add .select() to limit returned fields on remaining routes
    DONE: Added .select() to companies, news, events, blogs, opportunities,
    and debris API routes to return only needed fields. Reduces payload size.
[ ] Consider Prisma JSON field types instead of string
[x] Add database indexes review
    DONE: Added @@index directives to prisma/schema.prisma for commonly
    queried fields across Company, SpaceEvent, NewsArticle, SpaceBlog,
    SpaceOpportunity, SpaceDebris, OrbitalSlot, and other models.
[x] Implement max pagination limit (e.g., 100 items)
    DONE: constrainPagination() enforces max 100 items

3.3 EXTERNAL API OPTIMIZATION
-----------------------------
Issues:
- No request batching for external APIs
- Rate limits defined but not enforced
- No circuit breaker for failing APIs

Fixes:
[x] Implement rate limiting tracking
    DONE: Sliding window rate limiter in middleware
[x] Add circuit breaker pattern
    DONE: src/lib/circuit-breaker.ts implements open/half-open/closed states
    with configurable failure thresholds. Applied to RSS and external fetchers.
[ ] Batch requests where possible
[x] Add fallback data when APIs fail
    DONE: src/lib/api-cache.ts provides in-memory TTL cache. External API
    calls cache successful responses; on failure, serve cached data as
    fallback. Empty arrays returned when no cache exists.

3.4 BUNDLE SIZE OPTIMIZATION
----------------------------
[x] Review and optimize Three.js imports (tree shaking)
    DONE: Converted wildcard THREE imports to specific named imports where
    beneficial. Verified @react-three/drei uses named imports correctly.
[x] Lazy load heavy components (3D visualizations)
    DONE: Dynamic imports with next/dynamic for heavy components where found.
[x] Add bundle analyzer to identify large dependencies
    DONE: Installed @next/bundle-analyzer. Run with `npm run analyze`
    (sets ANALYZE=true). Configured in next.config.js.
[x] Consider dynamic imports for route-specific code
    DONE: All 18 module components in ModuleContainer.tsx converted to
    next/dynamic lazy imports. SolarExplorationModule uses ssr:false for Three.js.

================================================================================
4. UI/UX ENHANCEMENTS
