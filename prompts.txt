SPACENEXUS ACTIONABLE PROMPTS
Strategic Prompts for Platform Development, Marketing, and Business Growth
Document Date: February 7, 2026
================================================================================

Each prompt below is designed to be used with an AI assistant (Claude, GPT, etc.)
or as a structured task brief for a team member. Prompts include context about
SpaceNexus's current state to ground the output in reality.

================================================================================
UX AND FEATURE IMPROVEMENT PROMPTS
================================================================================

PROMPT 1: Company Intelligence Database Schema Design
------------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus (v0.7.4) is a space industry intelligence platform built on
Next.js 14, Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL, and TypeScript. We currently track ~50
space companies with basic profiles (name, ticker, description). Competitors like
Quilty Space and BryceTech offer detailed company deep-dives.

Task: Design a comprehensive Prisma schema for a Company Intelligence Database
that tracks: company profiles (name, HQ, founding date, employee count, website,
description, logo URL, CEO, public/private status), funding history (rounds with
date, amount, investors, valuation, series label), revenue estimates (annual,
source, confidence level), product/service catalog, key personnel with roles,
M&A history (acquirer, target, date, price, status), partnerships and JVs,
competitive landscape mapping, and SEC filing references. Include proper indexes,
relations, and migration strategy for our existing Company model. Provide the
Prisma schema, a seed script structure, and the Next.js API route pattern
following our existing convention in src/app/api/companies/route.ts.

PROMPT 2: Personalized Dashboard Builder
-----------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus currently has a ModuleConfigurator component that lets users
enable/disable modules and reorder them. Module preferences are stored in
localStorage with key 'spacenexus-module-config'. We have 10 main modules
rendered via ModuleContainer.tsx using next/dynamic imports.

Task: Design and implement a drag-and-drop dashboard builder that extends our
existing module system. Users should be able to: (a) create multiple named
dashboard layouts (e.g., "Morning Brief," "Investment Research," "Regulatory
Watch"), (b) resize widgets within a responsive grid (2-column on desktop,
1-column on mobile), (c) add widget-level data filters (date range, company
filter, category filter), (d) save layouts to the database for logged-in users
(fall back to localStorage for anonymous). Design the Prisma model
(DashboardLayout with widgets), the React components using a library like
react-grid-layout, and the API routes. Maintain backward compatibility with
the existing ModuleConfigurator flow.

PROMPT 3: Real-Time Launch Dashboard
-------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus has a Mission Control module with countdown timers for
upcoming launches, and a /live page. We track SpaceEvent data with fields for
isLive, streamUrl, and missionPhase. We use Three.js for 3D visualizations
(via @react-three/fiber) with ssr: false for client-only rendering.

Task: Design a rich "Launch Day" dashboard experience that activates
automatically when a launch is imminent (T-minus 6 hours). The dashboard
should include: (a) embedded livestream video player (YouTube/SpaceX webcast),
(b) real-time mission phase tracker with visual timeline showing phases from
pre_launch through mission_complete, (c) live telemetry display (altitude,
velocity, downrange distance -- simulated or from available APIs), (d) 3D
trajectory visualization showing the vehicle's flight path using our existing
Three.js setup, (e) live chat/discussion sidebar for community interaction,
(f) automated mission phase updates based on time markers. Provide component
architecture, WebSocket implementation plan, and data source strategy.

PROMPT 4: Smart Alert System Architecture
------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus has basic notification infrastructure (toast system in
src/lib/toast.ts, email via Resend, PWA push notification capability via
service worker). We have a webhook dispatcher in src/lib/webhook-dispatcher.ts.
Rate limiting exists in src/middleware.ts.

Task: Design a comprehensive alert system where users can create custom alert
rules with the following trigger types: (a) keyword match in news articles,
(b) stock price threshold (above/below/percent change), (c) new regulatory
filing by agency, (d) launch status change, (e) new contract award matching
criteria, (f) new company funding round, (g) space weather severity threshold.
Each alert should support multiple delivery channels: in-app notification,
email digest (immediate/daily/weekly), push notification, webhook (enterprise).
Design the Prisma models (AlertRule, AlertDelivery, AlertHistory), the background
processing pipeline (using node-cron which we already have), the user settings
UI, and the notification batching logic. Include rate limiting to prevent
notification fatigue (max 5 push/day, configurable).

PROMPT 5: Gamification and Engagement System
----------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus needs to increase user retention. Current average session
duration and return visit rate are unknown but likely low for an early-stage
product. We have user accounts with NextAuth, subscription tiers, and module
usage tracking potential.

Task: Design a complete gamification system for SpaceNexus with: (a) an
Achievement/Badge system with 20 unique badges across categories (Explorer,
Analyst, Community, Streak), with specific unlock criteria tied to measurable
actions (e.g., "Data Explorer" = use 5 different calculators), (b) daily/weekly
login streaks with visual streak counter and streak-based rewards (e.g., 30-day
streak unlocks exclusive "Mission Commander" badge), (c) a "Space IQ" score
that increases based on platform engagement and module exploration, (d) an
onboarding quest system that guides new users through key features with
progress rewards, (e) monthly leaderboards (opt-in). Provide Prisma models
(UserAchievement, UserStreak, UserEngagement), React components, and the
event-tracking hook architecture. Include A/B testing strategy to measure
impact on retention.

PROMPT 6: Mobile-First UX Overhaul
------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus is a PWA (service worker registration, 192x192 and 512x512
icons in public/icons/). It uses Tailwind CSS with responsive classes and has
mobile-specific hooks (useIsMobile, useSwipeGesture, usePullToRefresh). The
current mobile experience works but is essentially a responsive version of
the desktop layout, not a native-feeling mobile experience.

Task: Redesign the mobile experience to feel native-app-like. Include:
(a) bottom tab navigation replacing the sidebar on mobile, (b) swipe-based
navigation between modules (already have useSwipeGesture hook), (c) native-
feeling transitions between views using framer-motion (already a dependency),
(d) haptic feedback integration where available, (e) offline mode with cached
data for key modules (news, launches, watchlists), (f) home screen widget
strategy (next launch countdown, market snapshot), (g) mobile-specific data
density optimization (card-based layouts vs. table views). Provide wireframes
(described in detail), component updates, and the offline caching strategy
using our existing service worker.

================================================================================
MONETIZATION AND BUSINESS PROMPTS
================================================================================

PROMPT 7: Stripe Payment Integration
--------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus has subscription tiers defined in src/types/index.ts
(SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS: Free/Professional/Enterprise) with pricing
($0/$9.99mo/$29.99mo). The pricing page (src/app/pricing/page.tsx) has trial
start functionality via /api/subscription endpoint but no actual payment
processing -- the "Subscribe Now" button shows an alert saying "Payment
integration coming soon." We have a SubscriptionProvider component and
useSubscription hook. User model likely has subscriptionTier and trial fields.

Task: Implement complete Stripe payment integration including: (a) Stripe
Checkout for new subscriptions, (b) Stripe Customer Portal for managing
existing subscriptions, (c) webhook handler for subscription events
(created, updated, canceled, payment_failed), (d) trial-to-paid conversion
flow (3-day trial to auto-charge), (e) proration handling for plan upgrades/
downgrades, (f) invoice generation, (g) failed payment recovery emails.
Provide the API routes (src/app/api/stripe/route.ts, webhook.ts), Prisma
schema updates (stripeCustomerId, stripeSubscriptionId on User), the updated
pricing page component, and environment variable requirements. Follow our
existing validation pattern (Zod schemas + validateBody) and error handling
(src/lib/errors.ts).

PROMPT 8: API Product Design and Documentation
------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus has internal API routes for all modules under
src/app/api/. Data includes news articles, space events, companies with stock
data, compliance classifications, satellite data, launch vehicles, resource
exchange rates, and more. We have an api-cache layer (src/lib/api-cache.ts)
and circuit breaker (src/lib/circuit-breaker.ts).

Task: Design a commercial API product that exposes SpaceNexus data to
external developers and businesses. Include: (a) API key management system
(generate, revoke, rotate keys), (b) tiered rate limiting (Developer: 5K
calls/mo, Business: 50K, Enterprise: unlimited), (c) usage tracking and
billing integration, (d) API documentation portal (consider Swagger/OpenAPI
spec or a custom docs page), (e) endpoint catalog organized by domain (News,
Launches, Companies, Satellites, Regulatory, Market Data), (f) SDKs in
Python and JavaScript (scaffolding), (g) interactive API playground for
testing calls. Provide the middleware for API key authentication, the Prisma
models (ApiKey, ApiUsage), rate limiting logic, and the OpenAPI 3.0 spec
for at least 10 core endpoints.

PROMPT 9: Sponsored Content and Ad Revenue System
---------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus already has an AdBanner component (src/components/ads)
used on the homepage. We need to build a proper ad/sponsorship system that
generates revenue without degrading user experience, especially for paid
subscribers.

Task: Design a sponsored content and advertising system for SpaceNexus that
includes: (a) self-serve ad placement portal where space companies can buy
banner ads, featured listings, and sponsored content slots, (b) ad targeting
by module (e.g., an ad for a launch provider appears in Mission Planning),
(c) ad-free experience for Professional+ subscribers (as promised), (d) native
sponsored content format ("Sponsored Analysis" articles that maintain editorial
standards), (e) job listing sponsorship in Space Talent Hub, (f) analytics
dashboard showing impressions, clicks, and conversions. Design the Prisma
models (AdCampaign, AdPlacement, AdImpression), the advertiser-facing portal,
and the rendering components. Include pricing recommendations based on
space industry CPMs ($15-50 for niche B2B).

PROMPT 10: Government Procurement Strategy
--------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus tracks government contracts, has bid protest data, and
regulatory intelligence. The U.S. government space budget is ~$60B/year across
NASA, DoD (Space Force), NOAA, and others. SBIR/STTR programs specifically
fund small businesses developing innovative technologies.

Task: Write a detailed government procurement strategy for SpaceNexus
including: (a) which SBIR/STTR topics from Space Force (SpaceWERX), NASA,
and NOAA align with our platform capabilities, (b) a draft SBIR Phase I
proposal outline for a "Commercial Space Industry Intelligence Platform for
Space Domain Awareness Decision Support" topic, (c) GSA Schedule 70
application roadmap and timeline, (d) key government points of contact and
offices that would benefit from our platform, (e) pricing strategy for
government (typically 10-20% over commercial with added compliance
features), (f) FedRAMP Moderate considerations if targeting DoD/IC users.
Include specific solicitation references where possible and a 12-month
government business development timeline.

================================================================================
MARKETING CONTENT PROMPTS
================================================================================

PROMPT 11: SEO Pillar Content: Space Industry Complete Guide
-------------------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus needs to rank for "space industry" related keywords. We
currently have no long-form SEO content. The global space economy is $613B
(2024) and projected to reach $780B+ by 2033. Our platform covers 10 main
modules spanning news, market intelligence, operations, regulatory, and more.

Task: Write a comprehensive 3,000+ word guide titled "The Complete Guide to
the Space Industry in 2026: Markets, Technologies, and Opportunities." The
guide should cover: (a) space economy market size and growth, (b) key sectors
(launch, satellite, ground systems, exploration), (c) major companies and
their market positions, (d) government programs and budgets, (e) emerging
trends (cislunar economy, in-space manufacturing, space sustainability),
(f) career opportunities, (g) investment landscape. Naturally incorporate
internal links to SpaceNexus modules (e.g., "Track these companies in real-
time with our Market Intelligence module"). Include an FAQ section at the
bottom for featured snippet targeting. Write meta title and description
optimized for "space industry 2026" keyword cluster.

PROMPT 12: LinkedIn Content Calendar (30 Days)
------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus is launching its LinkedIn presence to reach space industry
decision-makers. Our platform offers real-time data, AI-powered insights,
regulatory intelligence, and interactive tools at $9.99-29.99/mo vs.
competitors at $3,000-15,000/year.

Task: Create a 30-day LinkedIn content calendar for SpaceNexus's company page

pre-launch checklist (teaser posts, community building, hunter outreach),
(f) post-launch follow-up plan. Include 5 alternative taglines and identify
3 potential Product Hunt "hunters" from the tech/space community who might
feature us.

PROMPT 14: Case Study Template: Enterprise Customer Success
-------------------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus needs case studies to support enterprise sales. Our target
customers include satellite operators, launch providers, space startups, law
firms with space practice, investment firms, and defense contractors.

Task: Create 3 fictional-but-realistic case study templates for SpaceNexus
enterprise customers: (a) "How [Satellite Operator] Uses SpaceNexus to
Monitor Competitors and Regulatory Changes" -- focus on real-time alerts,
compliance module, and market intelligence, (b) "How [Space VC Firm] Uses
SpaceNexus for Due Diligence and Deal Flow" -- focus on startup tracker,
company profiles, and financial analytics, (c) "How [Space Law Firm] Uses
SpaceNexus to Win More Clients" -- focus on regulatory hub, ITAR/EAR tools,
and spectrum management. Each case study should follow the format: Challenge,
Solution, Results (with specific metrics), Customer Quote. Make them realistic
enough to use as sales collateral once we have real customers to fill in.

PROMPT 15: Email Nurture Sequence for Free-to-Paid Conversion
---------------------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus offers a free tier with limited access (10 articles/day,
basic modules). We want to convert free users to Professional ($9.99/mo) or
Enterprise ($29.99/mo) plans. We have email capability via Resend and
email templates in src/lib/newsletter/email-templates.ts.

Task: Write a 7-email nurture sequence triggered when a user signs up for
a free account. The sequence should: Day 1: Welcome + quick value demo, Day 3:
"Did you know?" highlighting a premium feature they haven't tried, Day 5:
Social proof (industry stats about space professionals using data tools),
Day 7: Feature spotlight on AI Insights (premium), Day 10: Case study or
testimonial, Day 14: Trial offer (start your 3-day Pro trial), Day 21:
Final nudge with limited-time discount offer. Each email should be short
(under 200 words), mobile-optimized, with one clear CTA. Include subject
lines (A/B variants), preview text, and HTML template structure compatible
with our existing email template system.

================================================================================
NEW MODULE DEVELOPMENT PROMPTS
================================================================================

PROMPT 16: M&A and Deal Tracker Module
----------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus has a Space Market Intelligence parent module with
children: market-intel, space-economy, and startup-tracker. We track
companies with basic profiles and stock data. Our API pattern follows
src/app/api/companies/route.ts with Prisma queries, Zod validation, and
structured error handling.

Task: Design and implement a full M&A & Deal Tracker module for the space
industry. Include: (a) Prisma models for Deal (type: acquisition/merger/
partnership/JV/investment, parties involved, date announced, date closed,
value, advisors, status), (b) API routes for CRUD operations + search/filter,
(c) React page component with: visual timeline of deals, filterable table,
sector heat map showing consolidation trends, deal size distribution charts,
(d) deal alert system (notify when deals happen in tracked sectors/companies),
(e) seed data script with 30 real space industry M&A deals from 2023-2026
(e.g., L3Harris acquiring Aerojet Rocketdyne, Viasat acquiring Inmarsat).
Follow our existing module conventions: page in src/app/[slug]/page.tsx,
API in src/app/api/[module]/route.ts, types in src/types/index.ts.

PROMPT 17: Investor Intelligence Portal
-----------------------------------------
Context: Space industry VC investment reached $8.2B in 2024 with 200+
funding rounds. SpaceNexus tracks startups and companies but lacks dedicated
investor-focused tools. Investment professionals are a high-value customer
segment (willing to pay $4,990+/yr for Enterprise).

Task: Design an Investor Intelligence Portal module for SpaceNexus that
includes: (a) VC/PE deal flow dashboard with funding round timeline, amount
raised, investors, and valuation, (b) investor directory (space-focused VCs
and their portfolios), (c) comparable transaction analysis tool (select
companies, compare metrics side-by-side), (d) SPAC tracker (space-related
SPACs, status, de-SPAC performance), (e) IPO watchlist (companies likely
to go public), (f) investment thesis builder (template-driven analysis
framework), (g) portfolio monitoring dashboard (track multiple investments
with KPIs). Provide data models, API routes, seed data with real investors
(Bessemer, Space Capital, Seraphim, In-Q-Tel, etc.), and the React page
components. This should be an Enterprise-only feature.

PROMPT 18: Procurement Intelligence Module (SAM.gov Integration)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus has a government-contracts API (src/app/api/government-
contracts/) with init and listing endpoints. We also track bid protests in
the compliance module. U.S. government is 22% of the $613B space economy.

Task: Build a comprehensive Procurement Intelligence module that integrates
with SAM.gov and other government data sources. Include: (a) real-time
contract opportunity feed filtered for space/aerospace NAICS codes (336414,
336415, 336419, 517410, 541715), (b) contract award tracker with incumbent
analysis, (c) SBIR/STTR solicitation tracker (NASA, SpaceWERX, NOAA topics),
(d) budget tracker for key space line items (NASA appropriations by mission
directorate, Space Force budget by program), (e) congressional tracking
(committee hearings, authorizations, mark-ups relevant to space), (f) saved
search alerts for matching opportunities. Provide the SAM.gov API integration
code, Prisma models, and the React page with filters for agency, NAICS code,
set-aside type, value range, and deadline. Include error handling for API
rate limits and downtime.

================================================================================
DATA QUALITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROMPTS
================================================================================

PROMPT 19: Automated Data Freshness Monitoring System
-------------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus pulls data from multiple sources: RSS feeds for news,
Yahoo Finance for stocks, external APIs for launch data and solar weather.
We have a circuit breaker (src/lib/circuit-breaker.ts) and API cache
(src/lib/api-cache.ts). Data freshness is critical for user trust.

Task: Design an automated data freshness monitoring system that: (a) tracks
the last-updated timestamp for every data source and module, (b) defines
freshness SLAs per data type (news: 30 min, stocks: 5 min, launches: 1 hour,
regulatory: 24 hours, satellite TLEs: 12 hours), (c) displays a health
dashboard at /admin showing green/yellow/red status per data source, (d)
triggers automated re-fetch when data goes stale, (e) sends alerts to admins
when data sources fail for extended periods, (f) shows "Last Updated: X
minutes ago" indicators in the UI for each module. Provide the Prisma model
(DataSourceHealth), the monitoring cron job, the admin dashboard React
component, and the user-facing freshness indicator component. Integrate with
our existing logger (src/lib/logger.ts) and circuit breaker.

PROMPT 20: Multi-Source News Aggregation Pipeline
---------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus fetches news via RSS feeds using the rss-parser library
and stores articles in a PostgreSQL database. Content is sanitized with
sanitize-html. We have an AI-powered categorization system (news-categorizer
tested in src/lib/__tests__/news-categorizer.test.ts) and AI Insights
generation using the Anthropic Claude API.

Task: Design a robust multi-source news aggregation pipeline that: (a) pulls
from 20+ RSS feeds (SpaceNews, NASASpaceflight, Ars Technica, Space.com,
Via Satellite, Payload Space, The Verge Space, etc.), (b) de-duplicates
articles across sources using title similarity (Levenshtein or cosine),
(c) auto-categorizes into our existing NEWS_CATEGORIES (launches, missions,
companies, satellites, defense, earnings, M&A, development, policy, debris),
(d) extracts key entities (companies, people, locations, missions) using
NLP or regex, (e) generates relevance scores to prioritize display order,
(f) handles feed failures gracefully with fallback caching, (g) runs on a
configurable schedule (every 15 min for top sources, hourly for others).
Provide the cron job implementation using node-cron, the deduplication logic,
the enhanced categorizer, and the entity extraction approach. Include a
monitoring dashboard for feed health.

PROMPT 21: Database Performance and Scaling Strategy
------------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus uses Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL hosted on Railway. The
build command is "prisma db push || true && next build". We use .select()
for optimized queries and have database indexes on frequently queried fields.
As data grows (news articles accumulate daily, satellite data updates
frequently), we need a scaling strategy.

Task: Provide a comprehensive database performance and scaling strategy for
SpaceNexus covering: (a) index audit -- review our likely query patterns
(news by category + date, companies by sector, events by status + date,
satellites by constellation) and recommend composite indexes, (b) data
archival strategy -- move news older than 90 days to an archive table,
keep summaries accessible, (c) connection pooling optimization for Railway
(PgBouncer configuration), (d) read replica strategy for analytics queries
that don't need real-time consistency, (e) caching layer design (Redis or
in-memory) for hot data (trending articles, live launch data, stock prices),
(f) query optimization for our most expensive operations (full-text search,
aggregation queries for dashboards, time-series data for charts), (g)
monitoring setup (query latency tracking, slow query log analysis).
Provide specific Prisma schema additions, SQL for custom indexes, and
Railway configuration recommendations.

================================================================================
BUSINESS SCALING PROMPTS

strategy with specific outreach templates (cold email, LinkedIn message,
conference follow-up), (c) discovery call script with qualification
questions, (d) demo script highlighting features most relevant to each
ICP, (e) objection handling guide (too expensive, build vs buy, data
accuracy concerns, competitor comparisons), (f) pricing negotiation
framework (anchoring, bundling, multi-year discounts), (g) trial-to-close
conversion playbook (30-day enterprise trial milestones), (h) expansion
playbook (land in one department, expand to others). Include specific
email templates, LinkedIn message templates, and a sales metric framework
(pipeline stages, conversion rates, target cycle times).

PROMPT 23: International Expansion Plan
-----------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus is currently English-only, hosted on Railway (US
region), and primarily covers US space industry data (FCC, FAA, NASA,
SAM.gov). However, the space industry is global -- ESA, JAXA, ISRO, CNSA,
and emerging space nations (UAE, Australia, South Korea, etc.) represent
significant market opportunities. IAC 2026 is in Turkey.

Task: Create a phased international expansion plan for SpaceNexus covering:
(a) Phase 1 markets (UK, EU, Australia, Japan -- English-friendly or strong
space programs), (b) content localization strategy (which modules translate
well, which need regional data), (c) regulatory data expansion (ESA filings,
UK CAA, Australian Space Agency, JAXA procurement), (d) pricing strategy per
region (PPP-adjusted pricing for emerging markets), (e) partnership strategy
(international space agencies, regional accelerators, foreign universities),
(f) technical requirements (i18n setup in Next.js, CDN edge deployment for
latency, data residency considerations for EU/GDPR), (g) go-to-market
strategy for each Phase 1 market with specific conferences, publications,
and community channels to target.

PROMPT 24: Fundraising Preparation
-------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus is a bootstrapped space industry intelligence platform
at v0.7.4 with 10 main modules, AI-powered insights, and a freemium model.
The space economy is $613B and growing at 7.8% CAGR. Competitive products
charge $3,000-$15,000+/yr per seat. We need capital to hire an enterprise
sales team, expand data sources, and attend industry conferences.

Task: Prepare fundraising materials for a pre-seed or seed round of $500K-
$1.5M including: (a) investor pitch deck outline (12 slides: problem, solution,
market, product, traction, business model, competition, team, go-to-market,
financials, ask, vision), (b) detailed content for each slide with talking
points, (c) financial model assumptions and 3-year projection, (d) use of
funds breakdown, (e) target investor list (space-focused VCs: Space Capital,
Seraphim Capital, Starburst Ventures, Prime Movers Lab, Lux Capital, plus
relevant angels), (f) SAFE note vs. priced round analysis for our stage,
(g) key metrics we need to hit before raising (MRR, users, engagement).
Write the narrative around "Bloomberg Terminal for Space" positioning.

PROMPT 25: Partnership and Integration Strategy
-------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus uses several external data sources (RSS feeds, Yahoo
Finance, Space-Track TLE data) and has an Anthropic Claude API integration
for AI Insights. We need more data partnerships to differentiate from
competitors and provide higher-value data.

Task: Design a comprehensive partnership and integration strategy including:
(a) data partnerships to pursue (Space-Track.org for enhanced TLE data,
CrunchBase for startup data, Preqin for VC data, SAM.gov for contracts,
USPTO for patents, NOAA for space weather), (b) platform integrations that
increase stickiness (Slack/Teams for alerts, Salesforce for enterprise CRM,
Notion for report embedding, Google Sheets for data export), (c) co-marketing
partnerships (Space Foundation, SIA, AIAA -- co-branded reports and webinars),
(d) technology partnerships (Mapbox/Cesium for enhanced visualizations,
Anthropic for expanded AI features, Stripe Atlas for payment infrastructure),
(e) revenue-share models for data providers, (f) partnership outreach
templates and negotiation framework. Prioritize by impact and feasibility
for a small team.

PROMPT 26: Customer Success and Retention Playbook
-----------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus will have subscription tiers from free to enterprise.
We currently have a 3-day trial for paid plans. Churn is the biggest risk
to a subscription business. We need to ensure users realize value quickly
and continue to engage.

Task: Create a comprehensive customer success playbook including:
(a) onboarding flow for each tier (free: self-serve guided tour, Pro:
email-based onboarding sequence, Enterprise: white-glove onboarding with
success manager), (b) health scoring model (login frequency, module usage
breadth, alert creation, export usage, API calls -- weighted scoring),
(c) churn risk identification (no login in 14 days, only using 1 module,
decreasing engagement trend), (d) intervention playbooks (at-risk email
sequences, feature discovery prompts, personal outreach triggers), (e)
expansion strategies (Pro to Business, Business to Enterprise, single user
to team), (f) NPS/CSAT survey strategy (when to ask, how to act on
feedback), (g) quarterly business review template for enterprise accounts.
Include email templates, in-app message copy, and a health score
calculation formula.

PROMPT 27: Competitive Battlecard: SpaceNexus vs. Each Competitor
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus competes with SpaceWatch.Global (news/editorial),
BryceTech (market research reports), Quilty Space (financial intelligence),
NSR/Analysys Mason (forecasting/consulting), and Seradata/SpaceTrak
(satellite database). Each competitor has different strengths but none
offer the breadth of SpaceNexus at our price point.

Task: Create detailed competitive battlecards for sales teams covering each
of the 5 competitors. For each, include: (a) their positioning and target
customer, (b) their pricing (known or estimated), (c) their strengths (be
honest), (d) their weaknesses that SpaceNexus exploits, (e) common objections
when a prospect is considering them ("Quilty has better financial data"),
(f) our counter-narrative with specific feature comparisons, (g) migration
talking points ("switch to SpaceNexus and save $10,000/year while getting
real-time data instead of quarterly PDFs"), (h) when to walk away (customers
who truly need deep consulting that we cannot provide). Include a comparison
matrix table at the end.

PROMPT 28: AI-Powered Market Forecasting Engine
-------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus uses the Anthropic Claude API (claude-opus-4-6 model class)
for daily AI Insights generation (src/app/api/ai-insights/). We have historical
data on launches, funding rounds, company metrics, and regulatory filings.

Task: Design an AI-powered market forecasting engine for SpaceNexus that uses
historical data and Claude to generate: (a) launch cadence predictions (monthly
launch forecast by provider based on manifest + historical delay patterns),
(b) funding trend analysis (which sectors are heating up/cooling based on
trailing 6-month VC activity), (c) regulatory impact assessment (when a new
regulation is proposed, predict which companies/sectors will be most affected),
(d) M&A likelihood scores (which companies are likely acquisition targets
based on financial stress, competitive positioning, and market trends),
(e) "market pulse" daily summary combining all signals into a single
narrative. Design the data pipeline that feeds historical context to Claude,
the prompt engineering for each forecast type, the output format (structured
JSON + narrative), and the confidence scoring methodology. Include backtesting
approach to validate forecast accuracy over time.

PROMPT 29: Natural Language Search and Query System
-----------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus has a search page (src/app/search/page.tsx) and search
API (src/app/api/search/route.ts). Current search is likely basic text
matching. Users need to ask questions like "Which satellite operators filed
FCC applications in Q4 2025?" or "Show me Series B funding rounds above
$50M in the last year."

Task: Design a natural language search and query system for SpaceNexus that
allows users to ask questions in plain English and get structured results.
Include: (a) natural language query parser that converts questions to
database queries (using Claude as the NL-to-SQL engine), (b) entity
recognition to identify companies, dates, amounts, regulatory bodies in
queries, (c) structured result cards that show data relevant to the query
(tables, charts, timelines), (d) query suggestions and auto-complete based
on popular searches, (e) "Ask AI" feature that provides a narrative answer
alongside structured data, (f) query history and saved queries. Design the
prompt engineering for Claude to safely generate Prisma queries, the safety
layer to prevent SQL injection or destructive queries, and the result
rendering components. Include 20 example queries and their expected outputs.

PROMPT 30: Automated Content Quality Scoring
----------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus aggregates news from RSS feeds and generates AI Insights.
As content volume grows, we need automated quality scoring to surface the
best content and demote low-quality or duplicate articles. We have 10 news
categories and AI-powered categorization.

Task: Design an automated content quality scoring system that evaluates
every piece of content (news articles, AI insights, blog posts) on: (a)
relevance score (how relevant to space industry, scored 0-100), (b)
originality score (vs. existing content in database, using TF-IDF or
embedding similarity), (c) timeliness score (decay function based on
publication date and topic velocity), (d) source authority score (weighted
by publication reputation), (e) engagement prediction (estimated CTR based
on headline analysis and topic trending), (f) combined quality score with
configurable weights. The system should: auto-sort content feeds by quality,
flag low-quality content for review, identify trending topics by velocity,
and provide a "Top Reads" curated section. Provide the scoring algorithms,
the database schema updates, the background processing job, and the UI
components for displaying quality indicators.

USAGE GUIDE:
- Each prompt is self-contained and includes enough context to produce
  actionable output without additional research.
- Prompts reference specific files, patterns, and conventions in the
  SpaceNexus codebase (v0.7.4) for implementation accuracy.
- For technical prompts (1-8, 16-21), use with Claude or another AI
  assistant capable of generating production-quality code.
- For business/marketing prompts (9-15, 22-27), use with Claude or adapt
  as briefing documents for team members.
- For AI/data science prompts (28-30), these require careful prompt
  engineering and may need iterative refinement.
- Prioritize prompts based on the 6-month roadmap in strategic-brainstorm.txt.
