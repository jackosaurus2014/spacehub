## 1. Executive Summary

SpaceNexus is a space industry intelligence platform delivering real-time data, analytics, and business intelligence across 10 core modules: Mission Control, News & Media, Space Market Intelligence, Business Opportunities, Mission Planning, Space Operations, Space Talent Hub, Regulatory & Compliance, Solar System Expansion, and Space Environment. The platform operates on a freemium model with free, Pro, and Enterprise tiers, targeting space industry professionals, aerospace engineers, defense contractors, investors, startups, and government agencies.

The global space economy is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035 (up from $630 billion in 2023), with private sector growth outpacing government investment at a CAGR of 9.9%. This explosive growth creates massive demand for the kind of consolidated intelligence platform SpaceNexus provides. No single competitor offers the breadth of SpaceNexus's 10-module approach at an accessible price point.

This marketing plan outlines a phased approach across six months, beginning with pre-launch optimization and culminating in sustained growth through SEO, content marketing, paid advertising, community building, and strategic partnerships. The plan is designed for execution at three budget tiers: startup ($0-500/month), growth ($500-2,000/month), and scale ($2,000-5,000/month).

**Primary Goals (6-Month Targets):**
- 5,000 registered free-tier users
- 200 paid Pro subscribers
- 10 Enterprise pipeline conversations
- 50,000 monthly organic visits

### 7.1 Platform-Specific Strategies

**LinkedIn (PRIMARY -- Highest ROI for B2B)**

LinkedIn Strategy Overview:
- Company Page: 3-5 posts per week
- Founder Personal Profile: 3-5 posts per week (personal accounts get 5-10x more reach)
- Content mix: 40% industry insights, 30% product/data, 20% thought leadership, 10% culture/story

| Day | Company Page Content | Founder Personal Content |
|-----|---------------------|------------------------|
| Monday | Weekly space industry data chart | Personal insight on space industry trend |
| Tuesday | Blog post share with key takeaway | "Something I learned building SpaceNexus..." |
| Wednesday | Product feature spotlight | Industry opinion or hot take |
| Thursday | Company/module data highlight | Network engagement (comment on others' posts) |
| Friday | Curated links / "This week in space" | Personal story / building in public update |

LinkedIn Posting Best Practices:
- Use line breaks liberally (no walls of text)
- Start with a hook in the first 2 lines (before "see more" truncation)
- Include an image or chart (posts with images get 2x engagement)
- Use 3-5 relevant hashtags: #SpaceIndustry #NewSpace #SatelliteIndustry #SpaceTech #Aerospace
- Tag relevant people and companies when appropriate
- Ask a question or include a CTA at the end
- Post between 7-9 AM ET or 12-1 PM ET on weekdays
- Reply to every comment within 2 hours

LinkedIn Growth Tactics:
- [ ] Connect with 50 space industry professionals per week from founder's personal account
- [ ] Comment on 10 industry posts per day (substantive comments, not "Great post!")
- [ ] Join and actively participate in 5 LinkedIn Groups: Space Industry Professionals, Satellite Industry, NewSpace, Aerospace and Defense, Space Technology
- [ ] Publish 1 LinkedIn Article per month (long-form, 1,500+ words)
- [ ] Use LinkedIn polls for engagement: "What's the biggest challenge in space intelligence?"

Tweet Types:
1. **Launch countdowns:** "T-minus 2 hours until Falcon 9 launches 23 Starlink satellites. Track it live on SpaceNexus [link]"
2. **Data snapshots:** "[Chart image] Space startup funding hit $X.XB in Q1 2026. Here's where the money went: [thread]"
3. **Quick takes:** "Hot take: The biggest bottleneck in the space economy isn't launch costs anymore -- it's data fragmentation. Here's why..."
4. **Engagement:** Quote tweets, replies to industry figures, participation in space conversations
5. **Threads:** Weekly "Space Week in Review" thread (5-10 tweets summarizing key events)

Twitter Best Practices:

- Use 1-3 hashtags maximum (not more)
- Include images/charts whenever possible (tweets with images get 150% more retweets)
- Pin a tweet that explains what SpaceNexus is
- Create Twitter Lists to monitor: "Space Journalists", "Space Companies", "Space VCs"
- Engage in real-time during launches (live-tweet with SpaceNexus data)

**Reddit (TERTIARY -- Community Credibility)**

Reddit Strategy:

**LinkedIn Content Examples:**

*Hook-style post:*
```
Most space companies are making decisions with outdated data.

Here's what I mean:

- The average market report is 6+ months old by publication
- Government procurement data is scattered across 4+ platforms
- Launch schedules change weekly but most trackers update monthly

That's why we built SpaceNexus.
