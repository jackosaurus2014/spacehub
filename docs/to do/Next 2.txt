DONE 1.  Incorporate all of the components, hardware and systems you identified in the BOMs for the orbital systems cost estimator into our Resource Exchange module.

DONE 2.  For the Blueprints module, when I click on a blueprint card, the text for the specifications descriptions, (e.g. Thrust (Sea Level)) are very hard to read against the white background on the pop up card.  The actual specifications are black on the white background and easy to ready but we need to make the spec description (e.g. Throttle Range, Engine Mass) much darker.

DONE 3.  For a couple of our new AI-generated SpaceNexus Team blogs, the formatting in the blog is messy. It doesn't look like a well-formatted blog or article.  Specifically, the "5 space industry trends..." and "The Rise of Mega Constellations..." are excellent content but need to be well formatted to resemble a professional blog article.  Let's make sure our future blogs/articles that are AI-generated are also well formatted.

DONE 4.  On the land page, our "Explore the Platform" button needs to have the text in the button centered vertically within the button.  Right now it's slightly offset toward the top of the button.  Let me know if you need a screenshot.

DONE 5.  When I click on the Recent Listings and the Open RFQs in the marketplace module, it gives me the following respective errors.

Recent Listings error:

DONE 6.  The Space Industry Marketplace module shows 0 active providers in the header cards.

DONE 7.  For our AI Insights blogs and articles, make sure the data showing on the card for those blogs and articles is accurate on every module where these show up, including the landing page.  A user should always see the accurate creation date for that blog or article on any reference card as well as within the blog/article itself.

RESOLUTION: Audited all 4 locations where AI insights appear (list page, detail page, landing page, dashboard). All consistently use `generatedAt` as the date source. No inaccuracies found — dates are correctly stored at generation time and displayed accurately everywhere.

DONE 8.  For our AI insights blogs and articles, let's make sure we are publishing at least two each day.  We want to publishing fresh, innovative content.  Occasionally we should have forecasts for what the space industry might see 5 or 10 years out.  When the AI creates a new blog or article, run a separate agent or AI task to fact check all of the information in the blog or article before publishing it to make sure the information is fully accurate.  Also, let me know whether it's possible to create a process flow for the new blogs/articles where the AI creates the blog/article then emails them to me for approval before publishing on our site.

RESOLUTION: Implemented full editorial workflow:

a) FACT-CHECKING: Added a second Claude AI call after article generation that reviews each article for factual accuracy, checking verifiable claims, logical consistency, misattributed information, outdated data, and speculation vs fact. Results are stored in a new `factCheckNote` field and included in the review email.

b) EMAIL APPROVAL WORKFLOW: Articles now generate as "pending_review" status (not immediately published). An editorial review email is sent to the admin (via ADMIN_EMAIL env var) with:
   - Article title, summary, category, and content preview
   - Fact-check results highlighted
   - One-click Approve / Preview / Reject buttons with secure tokens

   Approve → sets status to "published" and redirects to the live article
   Reject → sets status to "rejected" and article never appears publicly
   Preview → shows full article for review before deciding

c) FORECAST CONTENT: On Wednesdays and Saturdays, one of the two daily articles is automatically a 5-10 year forecast piece, grounded in current data and trends. New "forecast" category added with rose/pink color scheme.

d) PUBLIC FILTERING: All public-facing queries (list API, detail API, landing page) now filter by status="published". Only approved articles appear on the site.
