TASK: Create "Estimated Orbital System Costs" page in Mission Planning
STATUS: COMPLETED (February 18, 2026)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ORIGINAL REQUEST
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Create a new page in the Mission Planning section of our website titled "Estimated Orbital System costs."  The purpose of this new module is to estimate the total costs of various types of orbital systems that are now in space and may be sent into space over the next 5-10 years.  The module will also show detailed information about what subsystems, components, hardware and potentially software would need to go into each of those orbital systems.  The idea is that a space entrepreneur could go into this page with the idea of building, launching and operating an orbital system such as a space habitat or space station, and get a pretty accurate estimate of all the items they would need to procure and what the total estimated cost for the venture would be.

In that page, let's create a card for each of the following types of orbital systems:  orbital habitat (small and large), orbital fabrication facility, orbital data center, orbital depot, orbital solar array (small, medium, large - and define small, medium and large by the estimated energy output of the solar array), and any other orbital systems your research uncovers as potentially feasible over the next ten years.  For each of these systems, research and analyze the hardware and components that would be required for these orbital systems.  Then determine a bill of materials for each of these systems based on the items that would go into them.  Finally, estimate the cost to purchase the items and lift them into orbit, as well as the cost to assemble them in space, if any.  Analyze whether any other costs might be relevant for getting these systems into space and operational.  Then provide those total estimated costs for each system on the card.  Allow a user to click on the card to see a detailed breakdown of (1) the estimated cost items going into the total cost, (2) the bill of materials for the orbital system; and (3) the estimated cost to insure such a system, with links back to our insurance tracker page if useful.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SUGGESTED FOLLOW-UP WORK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. INTERACTIVE COST CONFIGURATOR
   Allow users to adjust parameters like launch vehicle choice (Falcon Heavy vs Starship),
   contingency percentage, insurance rates, and see cost estimates update in real time.
   The data structure already supports this — just needs a UI slider/input layer.

2. STARSHIP PRICING SCENARIO
   Add a toggle to show costs with SpaceX Starship at $200/kg to LEO vs current
   Falcon Heavy at $1,500/kg. This dramatically changes economics for large systems
   (e.g., 100 MW solar array goes from $1.2B launch to $160M launch).

3. COMPARISON VIEW
   Side-by-side comparison of 2-3 systems, useful for investors evaluating where
   to allocate capital (e.g., "Should I fund a fabrication facility or a research lab?").

4. TIMELINE / GANTT VIEW
   Show the development-to-operational timeline for each system, highlighting
   parallel vs sequential phases (design, manufacture, test, launch, assembly, ops).

5. PDF EXPORT
   Allow users to export a system's full cost breakdown and BOM as a PDF report
   suitable for investor presentations or business plans.

6. DYNAMIC PRICING UPDATES
   Connect procurement costs to the Resource Exchange module's live commodity
   pricing data. When aluminum or titanium prices change, automatically update
   the BOM cost estimates.

7. COMPANY PROFILE CROSS-LINKING
   Link reference programs and suppliers in the BOM to their CompanyProfile pages
   (e.g., link "Northrop Grumman" in the habitat BOM to /company-profiles/northrop-grumman).

8. HISTORICAL COST TREND DATA
   Add a chart showing how orbital system costs have trended over time (ISS era
   vs commercial era vs projected Starship era), demonstrating the cost reduction curve.

IDEAS FOR NEW MODULES / CROSS-MODULE INTEGRATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. ORBITAL BUSINESS PLAN BUILDER (new module)
   Combine data from Orbital Costs + Mission Cost Simulator + Space Insurance +
   Launch Vehicles into an end-to-end business plan generator. User selects their
   orbital system type, SpaceNexus generates a full financial projection including
   CapEx, OpEx, revenue scenarios, break-even analysis, and NPV/IRR calculations.
   This would be a major differentiator — no other platform offers this.

2. SUPPLY CHAIN MAPPER (new module)
   Using the BOM data from Orbital Costs, create a visual supply chain map showing
   which companies manufacture which components, where they're located, lead times,
   and alternative suppliers. Cross-references with Company Profiles and the existing
   Supply Chain module.

3. ORBITAL ECONOMICS CALCULATOR (enhancement to Space Economy module)
   Add unit economics analysis: cost per crew-day for habitats, cost per kg of
   manufactured product for fabrication facilities, cost per kWh for solar power.
   Connect to Market Intel for market size data.

4. TECHNOLOGY READINESS TRACKER (new module)
   A dedicated tracker for TRL progression of key space technologies. The orbital
   costs data already includes TRL levels — extend this with historical TRL
   progression dates, expected maturation timelines, and funding sources advancing
   each technology.

5. VENTURE READINESS ASSESSMENT (enhancement to Business Opportunities)
   A wizard-style tool where a space entrepreneur answers questions about their
   planned venture, and SpaceNexus provides a readiness score based on technology
   maturity, market demand, regulatory complexity, capital requirements, and
   competitive landscape. Uses data from multiple existing modules.

6. IN-SPACE ASSEMBLY PLANNER (new module)
   For multi-launch systems (large habitat, medium/large solar arrays), provide a
   mission sequence planner showing how many launches are needed, what goes on
   each launch, assembly sequence, and estimated total campaign timeline. Links
   to Launch Windows and Launch Vehicles modules.

7. CROSS-LINK: Orbital Costs → Space Insurance
   Add a "Cost to Insure" quick-reference on the Space Insurance page showing
   insurance estimates for each orbital system type, linking back to the full
   cost breakdown.

8. CROSS-LINK: Orbital Costs → Launch Vehicles
   On the Launch Vehicles page, add a section showing "What can this vehicle
   launch?" — mapping vehicle payload capacity to which orbital systems fit
   in a single launch vs requiring multiple launches.

9. CROSS-LINK: Orbital Costs → Company Profiles
   Tag company profiles with the orbital system types they're developing or
   supplying components for. Show "Companies Working On This" section in the
   orbital costs detail view.

10. CROSS-LINK: Orbital Costs → Procurement Intelligence
    When SAM.gov procurement opportunities relate to orbital system components
    (e.g., NASA ECLSS procurement, solar array RFPs), cross-reference them
    with the relevant orbital system BOM items.
