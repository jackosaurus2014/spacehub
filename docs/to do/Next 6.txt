PROJECT TRACKER: Next 6 — Remaining Action Items from Competitive Research
STATUS: Not Started
CREATED: 2026-02-21
SOURCE: docs/COMPETITIVE-RESEARCH-AND-STRATEGY.md, docs/research/*.md

===============================================================================
COMPLETED IN THIS SESSION (for reference)
===============================================================================

- [x] Contract Award Feed (USASpending.gov API) — /procurement/awards
- [x] Company A vs B Comparison page — /compare/companies
- [x] Weekly Intelligence Brief email — /api/newsletter/intelligence-brief

These were the top 3 quick wins. The items below are EVERYTHING remaining.

===============================================================================
TASK A: EXECUTIVE MOVE TRACKER
===============================================================================
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: P0 — Immediate (Quick Win #4 from roadmap)
ESTIMATED EFFORT: Medium (1 session)
REVENUE IMPACT: Daily check-in habit — drives engagement + Pro retention

Why: Executive moves (C-suite, VP changes) are the #1 "water cooler" topic in the
space industry. Payload Space's newsletter thrives on this. No competitor has a
dedicated, searchable tracker. This creates a daily check-in habit.

What to Build:
- New page at /executive-moves (or /talent-moves)
- Track C-suite and VP-level job changes across space companies
- Data model: ExecutiveMove { person, fromCompany, fromTitle, toCompany, toTitle,
  date, source, companySlug? }
- Link moves to CompanyProfile records when possible
- Filter by: date range, company, role level, move type (hired/departed/promoted)
- "Notable moves this week" highlight section at top
- Company profile pages get a new "Leadership Changes" section

Data Sources:
- Manual curation initially (admin UI or seed script)
- Future: LinkedIn API (if partnership), press release parsing, news article NER
- RSS feeds from SpaceNews, Payload, NASASpaceFlight often announce moves
- Could add AI extraction from existing news articles (CompanyEvent model already
  has 'leadership_change' eventType — extend this)

Existing Infrastructure:
- CompanyEvent model (prisma/schema.prisma) already has eventType + companyProfileId
- CompanyProfile has keyPeople Json field (could parse for baseline data)
- News tagging system (tagRecentArticlesWithCompanies in news-fetcher.ts) could
  flag leadership-related articles

Files to Create:
- src/app/executive-moves/page.tsx — UI page with search/filters/timeline
- src/app/executive-moves/layout.tsx — SEO metadata
- src/app/executive-moves/loading.tsx — Skeleton
- src/app/api/executive-moves/route.ts — GET endpoint (query CompanyEvent where
  eventType = 'leadership_change') + POST for admin submission
- src/lib/executive-moves-data.ts — Seed data (50+ notable recent moves)

Files to Modify:
- prisma/schema.prisma — may need ExecutiveMove model or extend CompanyEvent
- src/app/company-profiles/[slug]/page.tsx — add "Leadership Changes" tab/section

===============================================================================
TASK B: SAVED SEARCHES & ALERT RULES
===============================================================================
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: P0 — Immediate (Quick Win #5 from roadmap, creates lock-in)
ESTIMATED EFFORT: Medium-Large (1-2 sessions)
REVENUE IMPACT: Pro conversion driver — switching cost moat

Why: This is a LOCK-IN feature. Once users invest time configuring custom alerts
(e.g., "notify me when NASA awards a contract > $10M to any company in my
watchlist"), they won't switch to a competitor. Bloomberg's alerting is one of its
stickiest features.

What to Build:
- SavedSearch model: query params, name, frequency (realtime/daily/weekly), userId
- AlertRule model: condition (field, operator, value), action (email/in-app/webhook),
  userId, enabled
- /alerts page — manage saved searches and alert rules
- Alert rule builder UI — pick data type (news, contracts, company events, launches),
  set conditions, choose notification method
- Alert delivery integration with existing alert system (src/lib/alerts/)

Existing Infrastructure:
- src/lib/alerts/ already has processor.ts, delivery.ts, templates.ts
- src/app/api/alerts/ already has route handlers
- Smart alert system infrastructure from v0.9.0
- Webhook dispatcher at src/lib/webhook-dispatcher.ts
- Newsletter email templates for styled notifications

Files to Create:
- src/app/alerts/page.tsx — Alert management dashboard
- src/app/alerts/layout.tsx, loading.tsx
- src/app/api/alerts/saved-searches/route.ts — CRUD for saved searches
- src/components/alerts/AlertRuleBuilder.tsx — condition builder UI

Files to Modify:
- prisma/schema.prisma — SavedSearch and AlertRule models
- src/lib/alerts/processor.ts — integrate saved search matching
- src/lib/cron-scheduler.ts — add alert digest cron job

===============================================================================
TASK C: DEAL FLOW DATABASE
===============================================================================
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: P1 — Short Term (Roadmap #6)
ESTIMATED EFFORT: Large (2-3 sessions)
REVENUE IMPACT: Very High — investors and BD teams will subscribe for this

Why: Every investor, BD professional, and journalist in space needs a database of
funding rounds, M&A deals, and major contract wins. Crunchbase charges $10K+/yr for
this. PitchBook charges $25K+/yr. We can build a focused space-only version that's
better for our niche at 1/100th the price.

What to Build:
- DealFlow model: type (funding_round, acquisition, ipo, spac, contract_win),
  amount, date, parties (investor/acquirer/target), stage, source, verified
- /deals page — searchable, filterable deal timeline
- Deal detail pages with linked company profiles
- Weekly/monthly deal volume charts (recharts)
- Deal type breakdown (pie chart by type, bar chart by quarter)
- "This Week in Space Deals" auto-generated summary (AI)

Data Sources:
- Manual curation + admin submission initially
- SEC EDGAR filings (IPOs, SPACs, 8-K material events) — free API
- Press releases from company profiles
- News article AI extraction (funding amounts often mentioned)
- USASpending.gov for contract wins (already integrated!)
- Space Capital quarterly reports (manual input of their published data)

Existing Infrastructure:
- FundingRound model in prisma/schema.prisma (on CompanyProfile)
- CompanyEvent model with eventType including 'funding', 'acquisition'
- src/lib/procurement/usaspending.ts — contract data already flowing
- Investment thesis generator at src/app/investment-thesis/page.tsx
- Funding tracker at src/app/funding-tracker/page.tsx

Files to Create:
- src/app/deals/page.tsx — Main deal flow page
- src/app/deals/[id]/page.tsx — Deal detail page
- src/app/deals/layout.tsx, loading.tsx
- src/app/api/deals/route.ts — GET (list/search) + POST (admin create)
- src/app/api/deals/[id]/route.ts — GET detail
- src/lib/deal-flow-data.ts — Seed data (100+ historical space deals)
- scripts/seed-deal-flow.ts — Database seeder

Files to Modify:
- prisma/schema.prisma — DealFlow model + relations to CompanyProfile
- src/app/company-profiles/[slug]/page.tsx — "Deal History" section
- src/lib/cron-scheduler.ts — weekly deal summary generation

===============================================================================
TASK D: DATA SOURCE INTEGRATIONS (Tier 1 — Free APIs)
===============================================================================
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: P1 — Short Term (Roadmap #14, from Section 4 of strategy doc)
ESTIMATED EFFORT: Large (2-3 sessions, parallelizable)
REVENUE IMPACT: Critical — enriches company profiles, creates proprietary data moat

Why: 6 free government APIs can immediately enrich our 101 company profiles with
financial data, patent portfolios, and government registrations. This data compound
over time and becomes irreplaceable — the longer we collect, the more valuable it
becomes. This is how Crunchbase built a $100M+ business.

### D1: SEC EDGAR Integration
What: Fetch 10-K/10-Q XBRL financials for ~20 public space companies
API: https://efts.sec.gov/LATEST/ — Free, 10 req/sec, User-Agent header only
Data: Revenue, net income, total assets, cash flow, quarterly/annual
New model: CompanyFinancials { revenue, netIncome, totalAssets, cashFlow, period,
  filingDate, source, companyProfileId }
Files: src/lib/data-enrichment/sec-edgar.ts, src/app/api/enrichment/sec/route.ts
Impact: Financial tab on company profiles becomes real data instead of estimates

### D2: USPTO PatentsView Integration
What: Fetch patent data by assignee for space companies
API: https://api.patentsview.org/patents/query — Free API key
Data: Patent number, title, abstract, grant date, CPC codes, citations
CPC codes for space: B64G (cosmonautics), H04B7/185 (satellite comms)
New model: CompanyPatent { patentNumber, title, abstract, grantDate, cpcCodes,
  citationCount, companyProfileId }
Files: src/lib/data-enrichment/uspto.ts, src/app/api/enrichment/patents/route.ts
Impact: "Patent Portfolio" section on company profiles, innovation scoring

### D3: GitHub API Integration
What: Track open-source activity for space companies with public repos
API: https://api.github.com — Free, 5K req/hr with token
Data: Repo count, stars, contributors, languages, last commit date
Orgs to track: spacex, nasa, esa, blueorigin, rocketlabusa, etc.
New model: CompanyGitHub { orgName, publicRepos, totalStars, totalForks,
  topLanguages, lastActivityDate, companyProfileId }
Files: src/lib/data-enrichment/github.ts, src/app/api/enrichment/github/route.ts
Impact: "Engineering Activity" section, tech stack insights

### D4: Extend SAM.gov Integration
What: Expand existing SAM.gov integration for deeper company enrichment
API: Already partially integrated at src/lib/procurement/sam-gov.ts
Data: Business classifications, socioeconomic status, past performance
Files: Modify src/lib/procurement/sam-gov.ts to fetch entity details
Impact: Government readiness scoring, set-aside eligibility on profiles

### D5: NASA SBIR/STTR Extension
What: Expand existing SBIR fetcher for historical company data
API: Already integrated at src/lib/procurement/sbir-fetcher.ts
Data: All historical awards per company, phase progression tracking
Files: Modify src/lib/procurement/sbir-fetcher.ts
Impact: "Innovation Pipeline" section on profiles, R&D investment tracking

### D6: FCC ULS Spectrum License Data
What: Parse FCC license data for satellite operators
API: https://www.fcc.gov/uls/transactions — Free bulk download
Data: Call signs, frequencies, orbital slots, license status, dates
New model: CompanyLicense { callSign, serviceType, frequency, orbitalSlot, status,
  grantDate, expirationDate, companyProfileId }
Files: src/lib/data-enrichment/fcc-uls.ts, src/app/api/enrichment/fcc/route.ts
Impact: Spectrum tab on company profiles, regulatory compliance status

Proposed Prisma Architecture (from strategy doc Section 4):
  CompanyProfile
    |-- CompanyFinancials (SEC EDGAR)
    |-- CompanyPatent (USPTO)
    |-- CompanyGitHub (GitHub API)
    |-- CompanyLicense (FCC ULS)
    |-- CompanySBIR (extend existing)
    |-- CompanyContract (from USASpending — already built!)

API Keys Needed:
- SEC EDGAR: User-Agent header only (no key)
- USPTO PatentsView: Free API key registration
- GitHub: Free personal access token (GITHUB_TOKEN env var)
- FCC ULS: None (bulk download)
- SAM.gov: Already have key
- SBIR.gov: Already integrated

===============================================================================
TASK E: SPONSORED COMPANY PROFILES
===============================================================================
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: P1 — Short Term (Roadmap #7)
ESTIMATED EFFORT: Medium (1 session)
REVENUE IMPACT: Direct revenue — $200-500/mo per sponsor (target: 10-20 sponsors)

Why: With 101 company profiles already built, offering companies a "Sponsored" or
"Verified" tier is the easiest revenue diversification. Companies pay to enhance
their profile with additional content, priority placement, analytics, and a
verified badge. ThomasNet (now Xometry) built $540M on this model.

What to Build:
- CompanyProfile.sponsorTier field: 'basic' (free), 'verified' ($200/mo),
  'premium' ($500/mo)
- Verified badge on profile cards and detail pages
- Premium features: custom banner, featured products showcase, lead capture form,
  profile analytics dashboard, priority search placement
- Self-service sponsorship signup flow (Stripe checkout)
- Admin approval workflow

Files to Create:
- src/app/company-profiles/sponsor/page.tsx — Sponsorship info/pricing page
- src/app/api/company-profiles/sponsor/route.ts — Sponsorship checkout
- src/components/company/SponsorBadge.tsx — Verified/Premium badge component
- src/components/company/ProfileAnalytics.tsx — Analytics for sponsors

Files to Modify:
- prisma/schema.prisma — add sponsorTier, sponsorSince, sponsorFeatures to
  CompanyProfile
- src/app/company-profiles/page.tsx — priority sorting for sponsors
- src/app/company-profiles/[slug]/page.tsx — sponsor enhancements
- src/lib/stripe.ts — new Stripe products/prices for sponsorship tiers

===============================================================================
TASK F: LAUNCH COST CALCULATOR TOOL
===============================================================================
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: P1 — Short Term (Roadmap #8)
ESTIMATED EFFORT: Small (1 session)
REVENUE IMPACT: Medium — SEO magnet, referenced constantly in the industry

Why: "How much does it cost to launch X kg to Y orbit?" is the most frequently
asked question in space business. A polished interactive calculator would rank #1
for "space launch cost" (high-volume search term). BryceTech publishes static PDFs
with this data. We can make it interactive.

What to Build:
- /launch-cost-calculator page — interactive tool
- Inputs: payload mass (kg), orbit (LEO/GTO/GEO/TLI/Mars), vehicle constraints
- Output: Ranked list of compatible launch vehicles with cost estimates
- Visual comparison chart (bar chart of $/kg across vehicles)
- Cost breakdown: launch service + insurance + integration + licensing
- "Request Quote" CTA linking to marketplace RFQ

Existing Infrastructure:
- src/lib/mission-cost-data.ts — already has launch vehicle data with per-kg costs
- src/app/launch-vehicles/page.tsx — vehicle specs with cost data populated
- src/app/mission-cost/page.tsx — mission cost estimation tools
- src/lib/orbital-costs-data.ts — detailed cost models

Files to Create:
- src/app/launch-cost-calculator/page.tsx — interactive calculator
- src/app/launch-cost-calculator/layout.tsx — SEO metadata (target: "space launch
  cost calculator", "how much does it cost to launch a satellite")
- src/app/launch-cost-calculator/loading.tsx

Files to Modify:
- src/lib/mission-cost-data.ts — ensure all vehicles have complete cost data

===============================================================================
TASK G: REGULATORY DEADLINE CALENDAR
===============================================================================
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: P1 — Short Term (Roadmap #9)
ESTIMATED EFFORT: Medium (1 session)
REVENUE IMPACT: Medium — compliance teams will pay for this

Why: FCC comment deadlines, ITU coordination milestones, FAA license renewals,
NOAA permit windows — missing a regulatory deadline can cost millions. No
competitor has a comprehensive space regulatory calendar. Compliance professionals
will pay $20-50/mo just for this.

What to Build:
- /regulatory-calendar page — visual calendar (monthly/weekly/agenda views)
- Deadline types: FCC filing, ITU coordination, FAA license, NOAA permit, ITAR,
  export control, congressional hearing, treaty milestone
- Color-coded by agency/type
- Email reminders (7-day and 1-day before deadline)
- Filter by agency, deadline type, relevance
- .ics calendar export (already have this pattern from events)
- Integration with existing alert system for notifications

Existing Infrastructure:
- src/lib/regulatory-hub-data.ts — rich regulatory types (PolicyChange,
  LicenseRequirement, TreatyInfo, etc.)
- src/app/compliance/page.tsx — regulatory hub with treaties and filings tabs
- Calendar .ics export already built (v0.4.2)
- Alert system at src/lib/alerts/

Files to Create:
- src/app/regulatory-calendar/page.tsx — calendar view
- src/app/regulatory-calendar/layout.tsx, loading.tsx
- src/app/api/regulatory-calendar/route.ts — GET deadlines + POST admin create
- src/lib/regulatory-calendar-data.ts — seed data (100+ known deadlines for 2026)

Files to Modify:
- src/lib/cron-scheduler.ts — add deadline reminder cron

===============================================================================
TASK H: ENHANCED API DOCUMENTATION & TIERS
===============================================================================
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: P1 — Short Term (Roadmap #10)
ESTIMATED EFFORT: Medium (1 session)
REVENUE IMPACT: $99-999/mo per API customer

Why: The commercial API (v1 endpoints) was built in v0.9.0 but the documentation
is minimal. Fintech companies, defense contractors, and data platforms will pay
$99-999/mo for programmatic access to our data. Proper documentation with
Swagger/OpenAPI spec, code examples, and a sandbox will convert API leads.

What to Build:
- Enhanced /developer page with full API documentation
- OpenAPI/Swagger spec for all v1 endpoints
- Interactive API explorer ("Try it" buttons)
- Code examples in Python, JavaScript, cURL
- Rate limit tiers: Free (100 req/day), Pro (10K req/day), Enterprise (100K req/day)
- API key management dashboard improvements
- Usage analytics for API customers

Existing Infrastructure:
- src/app/api/v1/ — existing v1 endpoints
- src/app/developer/page.tsx — basic developer portal
- src/lib/api-keys.ts — API key generation/validation
- src/lib/api-auth-middleware.ts — API auth middleware

Files to Create:
- src/app/developer/docs/page.tsx — full API documentation
- src/app/developer/docs/[endpoint]/page.tsx — per-endpoint docs
- src/app/developer/explorer/page.tsx — interactive API explorer
- src/lib/openapi-spec.ts — OpenAPI 3.0 specification

Files to Modify:
- src/app/developer/page.tsx — redesign as proper dev portal
- src/lib/api-auth-middleware.ts — add tier-based rate limits

===============================================================================
TASK I: SUPPLY CHAIN RELATIONSHIP MAP
===============================================================================
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: P2 — Medium Term (Roadmap #12)
ESTIMATED EFFORT: Large (2-3 sessions)
REVENUE IMPACT: Very High — enterprise value, unique and defensible

Why: "Who supplies whom?" is one of the most valuable questions in aerospace. A
visual graph showing supplier-customer relationships across the space industry
would be unique — no competitor has this. Defense BD teams and prime contractors
would pay enterprise rates for this visibility.

What to Build:
- /supply-chain-map page — interactive force-directed graph visualization
- Nodes = companies (sized by revenue/employee count)
- Edges = supply relationships (colored by type: component, service, integration)
- Click node to see company detail + all relationships
- Filter by: sector, relationship type, tier level
- "Degrees of separation" between two companies
- Relationship types: supplier, customer, partner, investor, competitor

Data Sources:
- Existing CompanyProfile.keyPartners, competitors fields
- Marketplace transaction data (buyer-seller relationships)
- News article analysis (partnership announcements)
- Manual curation from industry knowledge

Existing Infrastructure:
- src/app/supply-chain/page.tsx — supply chain module (basic)
- src/lib/infrastructure-data.ts — some relationship data
- CompanyProfile model with keyPartners, competitors, tags

Files to Create:
- src/app/supply-chain-map/page.tsx — interactive graph (use d3-force or similar)
- src/app/api/supply-chain/relationships/route.ts — relationship data endpoint
- src/lib/supply-chain-graph.ts — graph data model and algorithms

Files to Modify:
- prisma/schema.prisma — SupplyRelationship model (companyA, companyB, type,
  description, verified, source)

===============================================================================
TASK J: "SPACE SCORE" COMPANY RATING (0-1000)
===============================================================================
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: P2 — Medium Term (Roadmap #15)
ESTIMATED EFFORT: Medium (1 session)
REVENUE IMPACT: Brand asset + differentiation — like CB Insights' Mosaic Score

Why: CB Insights built their brand around the "Mosaic Score" for private companies.
SpaceFund has a 0-9 "Reality Rating." We can create the "Space Score" (0-1000) that
becomes THE industry standard for evaluating space companies. This is a permanent
brand asset once adopted.

What to Build:
- Composite score (0-1000) for each CompanyProfile based on:
  - Innovation (patents, SBIR awards, R&D spend) — 200 pts
  - Financial Health (revenue growth, funding, runway) — 200 pts
  - Market Position (contracts won, market share, partnerships) — 200 pts
  - Operational Capacity (satellites, facilities, employees) — 200 pts
  - Growth Trajectory (hiring velocity, deal flow, media mentions) — 200 pts
- Score breakdown visualization (radar/spider chart)
- Historical score tracking (monthly snapshots)
- Leaderboard page: Top 100 Space Companies by Space Score
- Badge on all company profile cards and detail pages
- Methodology page explaining the scoring (transparency builds trust)

Existing Infrastructure:
- CompanyScore model in prisma/schema.prisma (already has technology,
  market_position, financial_health, growth fields)
- src/app/company-profiles/page.tsx — can add score column/badge
- Recharts for visualizations

Files to Create:
- src/lib/space-score.ts — scoring algorithm
- src/app/space-score/page.tsx — leaderboard + methodology
- src/app/api/space-score/route.ts — GET scores, POST recalculate
- src/components/company/SpaceScoreBadge.tsx — visual badge (0-1000)
- scripts/calculate-space-scores.ts — batch calculation script

Files to Modify:
- prisma/schema.prisma — add compositeScore field to CompanyProfile
- src/app/company-profiles/page.tsx — show score badge
- src/app/company-profiles/[slug]/page.tsx — score breakdown section

===============================================================================
TASK K: CONFERENCE/EVENT CALENDAR
===============================================================================
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: P2 — Medium Term (Quick Win from Section 6)
ESTIMATED EFFORT: Small-Medium (1 session)
REVENUE IMPACT: Medium — engagement driver, "nobody has comprehensive" per research

Why: The strategy doc noted "nobody has a comprehensive conference/event calendar"
for the space industry. SATShow, Space Symposium, IAC, SmallSat, NewSpace — there
are 50+ events per year. A curated, searchable calendar with registration links,
speaker lists, and networking features is an easy win.

What to Build:
- /events-calendar page — monthly/list calendar of space industry events
- Event types: conference, webinar, launch, regulatory hearing, trade show
- Event details: name, dates, location, website, registration link, speakers,
  exhibitors, estimated attendance
- Filter by: type, location, date range, free/paid
- .ics export for individual events (already have this pattern)
- "Add to Calendar" buttons (Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple)
- "Who's attending?" social feature (future: networking)

Existing Infrastructure:
- src/app/space-events/page.tsx — already exists with event data!
- Calendar .ics export from v0.4.2

Files to Create/Modify:
- Extend src/app/space-events/page.tsx with calendar view
- Add src/lib/space-events-data.ts with 50+ events for 2026-2027
- Add monthly calendar visualization component

===============================================================================
TASK L: REVENUE DIVERSIFICATION — CUSTOM REPORTS
===============================================================================
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: P2 — Medium Term (Roadmap #13, Revenue Section 7)
ESTIMATED EFFORT: Medium (1 session)
REVENUE IMPACT: $500-5,000 per report

Why: Quilty charges $5K-$25K for custom research reports. BryceTech gives away
PDF reports to sell consulting. We can auto-generate data-rich reports using
Claude + our aggregated data, then offer them at $500-$5,000 (10x cheaper than
Quilty). Topics: "State of [Sector]", "Company Deep Dive", "Market Entry Analysis".

What to Build:
- /reports page — catalog of available reports (free samples + paid)
- AI-generated report builder: pick topic/company/sector, choose depth
- PDF export with SpaceNexus branding
- Report types:
  - Sector Overview ($500): market size, key players, trends, forecasts
  - Company Deep Dive ($1,000): full profile + financial analysis + competitors
  - Competitive Analysis ($2,000): head-to-head comparison of 3-5 companies
  - Market Entry Brief ($5,000): regulatory requirements, TAM, competitive
    landscape, recommended strategy
- Stripe checkout for paid reports

Existing Infrastructure:
- Anthropic SDK for AI generation
- CompanyProfile data for company deep dives
- Deal flow + contract data for market analysis
- src/lib/chart-export.ts — chart-to-image for report embedding

Files to Create:
- src/app/reports/page.tsx — report catalog
- src/app/api/reports/generate/route.ts — report generation endpoint
- src/lib/report-generator.ts — AI report builder
- src/lib/report-templates.ts — report type templates and prompts

===============================================================================
TASK M: PROFESSIONAL MESSAGING / COMMUNITY
===============================================================================
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: P3 — Long Term (Roadmap #11, #17)
ESTIMATED EFFORT: Very Large (4-6 sessions)
REVENUE IMPACT: Strongest long-term moat — Bloomberg's messaging is its #1 moat

Why: The strategy doc identified community/messaging as the ULTIMATE moat.
Bloomberg Terminal's most unassailable feature is its messaging network — 325K
professionals who can't switch because their entire contact network is there.
In a ~15,000-person space industry, if SpaceNexus becomes where professionals
maintain relationships, switching costs become insurmountable.

What to Build (Phased):
Phase 1: Follow/Connect features
- Follow companies and topics for personalized feeds
- "People also viewed" signals on company profiles
- Professional directory with public profiles

Phase 2: Direct Messaging
- 1:1 messaging between verified professionals
- Message threads linked to companies/deals
- Read receipts and typing indicators
- Mobile push notifications

Phase 3: Industry Forums
- Topic-based discussion boards (propulsion, regulation, funding, etc.)
- Company-specific discussion threads
- Expert Q&A format

Phase 4: Networking Features
- "Who's attending [event]?" matching
- Introduction requests through mutual connections
- Virtual meetup scheduling

Existing Infrastructure:
- Deal rooms (src/app/deal-rooms/) already have messaging-like features
- User model with authentication
- WebSocket potential via Next.js server actions
