1.  Government Procurement Strategy
--------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus tracks government contracts, has bid protest data, and
regulatory intelligence. The U.S. government space budget is ~$60B/year across
NASA, DoD (Space Force), NOAA, and others. SBIR/STTR programs specifically
fund small businesses developing innovative technologies.

Task: Write a detailed government procurement strategy for SpaceNexus
including: (a) which SBIR/STTR topics from Space Force (SpaceWERX), NASA,
and NOAA align with our platform capabilities, (b) a draft SBIR Phase I
proposal outline for a "Commercial Space Industry Intelligence Platform for
Space Domain Awareness Decision Support" topic, (c) GSA Schedule 70
application roadmap and timeline, (d) key government points of contact and
offices that would benefit from our platform, (e) pricing strategy for
government (typically 10-20% over commercial with added compliance
features), (f) FedRAMP Moderate considerations if targeting DoD/IC users.
Include specific solicitation references where possible and a 12-month
government business development timeline.


2: LinkedIn Content Calendar (30 Days)
------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus is launching its LinkedIn presence to reach space industry
decision-makers. Our platform offers real-time data, AI-powered insights,
regulatory intelligence, and interactive tools at $9.99-29.99/mo vs.
competitors at $3,000-15,000/year.

Task: Create a 30-day LinkedIn content calendar for SpaceNexus's company page
with: (a) 30 post drafts with copy, suggested image/chart descriptions, and
hashtags, (b) mix of content types: thought leadership (40%), product
showcases (25%), industry insights (20%), engagement posts (15%), (c) posting
schedule (1 post/day, optimal times for B2B: Tue-Thu 8-10 AM), (d) 5 LinkedIn
article outlines for long-form publishing, (e) 10 carousel post concepts
(educational content in slide format). Content themes should rotate through:
"Space Market Monday," "Tech Tuesday," "Watchlist Wednesday," "Talent
Thursday," "Launch Friday." Include specific calls-to-action driving traffic
to SpaceNexus modules.

3: Product Hunt Launch Strategy
-----------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus is a web app built on Next.js, deployed on Railway, with
a space-themed UI. It has 10 main modules, AI-powered insights (Claude API),
3D solar system visualization (Three.js), and a freemium pricing model.

Task: Create a complete Product Hunt launch strategy including: (a) product
tagline and description (under 260 chars), (b) maker comment text, (c) 6
product screenshots with descriptions highlighting the most visually
impressive features (Mission Control countdown, 3D solar exploration,
AI Insights, satellite tracker, regulatory hub, market intelligence), (d)
launch day timeline (preparation, posting time, response strategy), (e)
pre-launch checklist (teaser posts, community building, hunter outreach),
(f) post-launch follow-up plan. Include 5 alternative taglines and identify
3 potential Product Hunt "hunters" from the tech/space community who might
feature us.

4: Case Study Template: Enterprise Customer Success
-------------------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus needs case studies to support enterprise sales. Our target
customers include satellite operators, launch providers, space startups, law
firms with space practice, investment firms, and defense contractors.

Task: Create 3 fictional-but-realistic case study templates for SpaceNexus
enterprise customers: (a) "How [Satellite Operator] Uses SpaceNexus to
Monitor Competitors and Regulatory Changes" -- focus on real-time alerts,
compliance module, and market intelligence, (b) "How [Space VC Firm] Uses
SpaceNexus for Due Diligence and Deal Flow" -- focus on startup tracker,
company profiles, and financial analytics, (c) "How [Space Law Firm] Uses
SpaceNexus to Win More Clients" -- focus on regulatory hub, ITAR/EAR tools,
and spectrum management. Each case study should follow the format: Challenge,
Solution, Results (with specific metrics), Customer Quote. Make them realistic
enough to use as sales collateral once we have real customers to fill in.

5: Email Nurture Sequence for Free-to-Paid Conversion
---------------------------------------------------------------
Context: SpaceNexus offers a free tier with limited access (10 articles/day,
basic modules). We want to convert free users to Professional ($9.99/mo) or
Enterprise ($29.99/mo) plans. We have email capability via Resend and
email templates in src/lib/newsletter/email-templates.ts.

Task: Write a 7-email nurture sequence triggered when a user signs up for
a free account. The sequence should: Day 1: Welcome + quick value demo, Day 3:
"Did you know?" highlighting a premium feature they haven't tried, Day 5:
Social proof (industry stats about space professionals using data tools),
Day 7: Feature spotlight on AI Insights (premium), Day 10: Case study or
testimonial, Day 14: Trial offer (start your 3-day Pro trial), Day 21:
Final nudge with limited-time discount offer. Each email should be short
(under 200 words), mobile-optimized, with one clear CTA. Include subject
lines (A/B variants), preview text, and HTML template structure compatible
with our existing email template system.
