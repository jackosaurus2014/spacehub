# SpaceNexus Overnight Project Tasks - COMPLETED
# Date: February 5, 2026

================================================================================
## BUG FIXES - ALL COMPLETED
================================================================================

### 1. Blueprint Series Navigation - FIXED
**Problem:** Blueprint Series button on the left menu bar didn't navigate to the module.
**Solution:** Added Blueprint Series to both Navigation.tsx (TOOLS_ITEMS dropdown) and
QuickAccessSidebar.tsx (MODULE_ROUTES mapping).
**Files Modified:**
- src/components/Navigation.tsx - Added to TOOLS_ITEMS array
- src/components/QuickAccessSidebar.tsx - Added 'blueprints': '/blueprints' route

### 2. Mission Cost Simulator Navigation - FIXED
**Problem:** Mission Cost Simulator on the left menu didn't navigate to the module.
**Solution:** Added Mission Cost Simulator to both Navigation.tsx and QuickAccessSidebar.tsx.
**Files Modified:**
- src/components/Navigation.tsx - Added to TOOLS_ITEMS array
- src/components/QuickAccessSidebar.tsx - Added 'mission-cost': '/mission-cost' route

### 3. Space Mining Page Error - FIXED
**Problem:** TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLocaleString')
**Root Cause:** The formatNumber function didn't handle null/undefined values from API responses.
**Solution:** Updated formatNumber function to return '0' for null/undefined values.
**File Modified:** src/app/space-mining/page.tsx
**Code Change:**
```typescript
function formatNumber(n: number | null | undefined): string {
  if (n === null || n === undefined) return '0';
  return n.toLocaleString();
}
```

### Additional Fix: PWA Icons (Non-Critical)
**Issue:** icons/icon-192x192.png returning 404 errors
**Status:** Noted for future fix - needs icon files created at public/icons/
